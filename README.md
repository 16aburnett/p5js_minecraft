# P5js MineCraft
Author: Amy Burnett

This is just a fun project where I attempt to make a MineCraft-like game using P5js.

# Setup

Since this project uses P5js, you should be able to host a local server and play the game via a browser.

```bash
# obtain the source code
git clone git@github.com:16aburnett/p5js_minecraft.git
cd p5js_minecraft/code/
# start a server
python3 -m http.server
```

You should be able to play the game, by going to http://localhost:8000/.
